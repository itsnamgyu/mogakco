## Project Structure

~~Will employ [this structure](https://www.revsys.com/blog/2014/nov/21/recommended-django-project-layout/)...~~~

Too [complicated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NPBIwQyPWE) and doesn't really tell you how to divide the project into apps.

Lets try to use common sense and group things into apps based on the models they interact with, i.e., everything about showing, editing cafes should be grouped into the `cafe` app.

Thanks to [J. C. Leit√£o@StackOverlflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18270898/django-best-practice-for-splitting-up-project-into-apps)


## Coding Convensions

Follow the pep8 coding guide (no-brainer for Python). Try to check your code with flake8 before committing. It's included in requirements.txt! Just do this.

```bash
flake8 ho.py
```
